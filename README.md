## How to run the code 

## Frist step 

### Create the pairwise combination of treatments 

`python combine_dfs.py Age_W5`

## Second step

Run the main.R code that is Jinsong code:

`.\statistical_code\main.R`

## Third step

Add feature names to the output of Jinsong code

`python add_feature_names_csv.py`


## Forth step

Aggretating the p-values of all treatments. 

`python analysis.py w5`
